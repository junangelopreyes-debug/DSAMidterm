# Step-By-Step Procedure of Setting Up Git,Github, and VSC (Visual Studio Code)
So you want to start coding? Well, there are many tools around the internet you can use to start coding, but these three components will help you jumpstart your journey with coding. I am Angelo of BSCpE 1-1, and today I will help you install Git, Visual Studio Code (VSC) and setup your own account at Github.
#### Ready to Start?
#### Alright! Let's go first with installing Git!
## Installing Git
Git is a free, open-source tool for tracking changes to files, especially code, over time. Think of it as a "time machine" or advanced "undo" button for your projects. It lets you save snapshots of your work, go back to older versions, and collaborate without losing anything. So how do you install it into your device?
1. Open your web browser and search Git download or go to this link https://git-scm.com/
2.	Go to install
3.	Select which OS (Operating Software) you are currently using, and follow the corresponding instructions how to download it (In this case, select the "Git for Windows/x64 Setup." for windows in the "Standalone Installer" row).
4.	After it has been downloaded, click the installer in your downloads folder.
5.	Follow the instructions and click next.
6.	After the installation, there are two ways to check if Git has been installed in your computer:
*	First Way : Create a new folder in your computer and press right click inside of it, then go to "Show More Options" and if you see a "Git Bash" and "Git GUI" then git has been installed into your computer. (If you are using Windows 10, just right click your mouse into the empty folder and you can already see if Git is installed in your computer)
*   Second Way : Go to your computer's search bar and search Git and it will pop up if your Git isn't installed.

#### Next Up : Setting Up GitHub
GitHub is like this giant online storage locker and collaboration hub for people who build software, write code, or manage projects. It's built on a tool called Git, which helps track changes to files over time, kind of like a "save" button with a history log. Think of it as Google Drive for programmers, but with extra features for teamwork and sharing.
1.	Open your web browser and search GitHub or go to this link https://github.com/
2.	Go to Sign up that is located at the upper right of the website
3.	Create your account follow the procedures displayed on the process
4.	That's it, you're done setting up your GitHub account!
