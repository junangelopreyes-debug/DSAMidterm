# Basic and Essential operations within Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code
Here are some of the operations you can use within Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code
## Git
1.	**Initialize a Repository**: Start tracking a project. Command: git init (creates a hidden .git folder in your project directory).
2.	**Add Files**: Stage changes for the next commit. Command: git add <filename> (or git add . for all files).
3.	**Commit Changes**: Save a snapshot of your staged changes with a message. Command: git commit -m "Your message here".
4.	**Check Status**: See what's changed, staged, or untracked. Command: git status.
5.	**View History**: Look at past commits. Command: git log (shows commit messages, authors, and dates).

## GitHub
1.	**Create a Repository**: Start a new project on GitHub. Go to github.com, click "New repository," name it, and choose public/private.
2.	**Fork a **Repository**: Copy someone else's public repo to your account for personal changes. Click "Fork" on the repo page.
3.	**View Code and History**: Browse files, commits, and branches on the GitHub website. Use the search bar for specific code.
4.	**Issues**: Report bugs or request features. On a repo page, click "Issues" > "New issue," describe the problem, and assign labels.
5.	**Collaborate**: Invite others to your repo via Settings > Collaborators. They can push directly or submit PRs.

## Visual Studio Code
1.	**Open a Repository**: File > Open Folder, then select a Git repo. VS Code detects it and shows Git icons in the sidebar.
2.	**View Changes**: In Source Control, see diffs (differences) between files. Click a file to review line-by-line changes.
3.	**Extensions for GitHub**: Install "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" extension to manage PRs and issues right in VS Code.
4.	**Stage and Commit**: In the Source Control sidebar (Git icon), click "+" to stage files, enter a commit message, and click the     checkmark to commit.
5.	**Integrated Terminal**: Run Git commands directly in VS Code's terminal (View > Terminal) for advanced operations.
